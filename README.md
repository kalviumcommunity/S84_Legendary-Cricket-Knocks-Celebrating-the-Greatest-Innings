"Legendary Cricket Knocks: Celebrating the Greatest Innings"

***Project Overview***

This project would aim to create an engaging and interactive platform that showcases some of the greatest cricket innings ever played. Detailed analyses, video highlights, stats, and narratives will be featured in curations of iconic cricket knocks. The package will be both educational for cricket buffs and an expression of the rich heritage of the game.

*Curated Knock Profiles:*

Each featured inning will include the player, match details, scorecard, and context (e.g., significance in the match or tournament).

*Interactive Stats Visualizations:*

Show innings data through graphs and charts (strike rate progression, wagon wheels, pitch maps, etc.).

Embed video highlights or link to official cricket archives.

*Fan Engagement:*

Let users upvote their favorite innings, leave comments, and share their opinions.
